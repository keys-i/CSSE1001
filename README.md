## Usage

```bash
python3 A1/a1.py
```

It can also be used as a module:
```bash
python3
>>> from A1 import a1
>>> a1.play_game()
```
This can also be used to inspect the functions in the module.

You can quit the game in two ways:
either use the `q` command or answer `n` to quit, or simply use Ctrl-C to
quit.
